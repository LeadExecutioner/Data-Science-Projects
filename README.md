# Data-Science-Projects

A collection of data science projects implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms:

1) Traffic Sign classification- A prerequisite for self-driving cars. The project builds and uses a deep neural network model to classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. 
With this model, users are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

2) Chatbot- Important for AI, the project will build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. Special recurrent neural network (LSTM) is used to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then give a random response from the list of responses.

3) Emoji creator- The project will build a deep learning model to classify facial expressions from the images provided by user. This will map the classified emotion to an emoji or an avatar.

4) Face mask detector- The project will build a real-time system to detect whether the user on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. The face mask detector model is trained using Keras and OpenCV.

5) Handwritten character recognition- The project implements the use of neural network modelling trained using a dataset of images for alphabets.

6) Human detection and counting- The project is going to build the Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam or provide results from user-provided video or images using computer vision, implementing concepts of deep learning.

7) Lane line distribution- Another prerequisite for self-driving cars. The project is going to use computer vision techniques in Python to identify road lane lines in which autonomous cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars for preventing accidents.

8) Sign language recognition- The project creates a sign detector for decting numbers from 1 to 10 taking input from hand guestures.

9) Smile selfie capture- The project will capture images every time the user smiles using OpenCV by implementing machine learning.

10) Video surveilance- The project will use spatio temporal autoencoder, which is based on a 3D convolution network, implementing deep learning. The abnormal events are identified by computing the reconstruction loss using Euclidean distance between original and reconstructed batch.

11) Object tracking using camshift- Object tracking is defined as a problem of locating a moving object over time in a video or in a real-time camera feed. The project implements OpenCV's camshift algorithm for performing object tracking

12) Youtube recommendation system- The project is built using PyTorch for training the dataset and implementating deep neural network for performing recommendation

13) Pedestrian detection project- The project is built using a pre-trained machine learning model for detecting people / pedestrian from a video feed, using either a webcam or video file. The pre-trained model used for the task is the yolov4-tiny for performing detection

14) Text summarization project- The project is built implementing deep learning algorithms and using natural language processing

15) Background removal project- Background removal is presently a quite important feature for video calling especially for professional meetings. The project is built using OpenCV and MediaPipe framework.

16) Custom object detection using yolo- Object detection is one of the most common tasks of computer vision. Applications of object detection include identifying objects to complex tasks, understanding different scenarios and making decisions based on them which can be important for self-driving cars and other tools implementing modern technology. Security cameras and even modern-day smartphones all have these capabilities built-in with them for various tasks. The project is built using YOLO V5.
